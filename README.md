**rgui** = the **R**enormalization **G**roup **U**ser **I**nterface — that is the name's
original purpose. (That the same letters also read as *readable grid* and *Royal Gramma*,
our mascot, is a happy accident we keep for fun.)

In physics, the renormalization group describes how a system looks at different scales:
zoom out, and microscopic detail is *coarse-grained* away — only the couplings that matter
at that scale survive. rgui applies exactly this to user interfaces. **Zoom is an RG flow**:
every element snaps to a screen-adaptive grid and stays legible at any zoom level, and whatever
cannot be drawn readably is not dropped but *replaced by a readable abstraction* via
semantic-zoom level-of-detail (LOD). Ships a Canvas 2D renderer today, with a WebGPU renderer
behind the same interface next. The only runtime dependencies are `d3-zoom` and `d3-selection`.

## What is rgui?

rgui is a framework-agnostic library that carries one principle through the whole UI:
the **readable grid**. The principle reduces to two rules.

1. **Every element snaps to a screen-adaptive, radix-layered grid.** Grid scales are powers
   of a configurable radix (default 8): one higher-order cell spans radix sub-steps per axis.
   The major spacing is continuously re-chosen so it always keeps a readable pixel width, and
   **sizes obey the node-size law**: a node spans an integer 1..radix grids at *some* layer —
   needing more promotes it to the next layer, snapped up (9 grids at layer *s* → 2 grids at
   layer *s+1*). Positions snap to the finer of the visible grid and the node's own layer.
2. **The view is readable at every zoom — because zoom is a renormalization-group flow.**
   The moment an element can no longer be drawn readably at the current scale, it does not
   vanish; it is replaced by a readable abstraction. This is semantic-zoom LOD: just before
   detail would smear, nodes collapse into pseudo-nodes, and nearby elements coarse-grain into
   a single cluster based on position. Nothing unreadable is ever left on screen — only the
   relevant couplings survive at each scale.

Rendering is currently Canvas 2D, but the renderer is swappable behind a single interface,
with a WebGPU implementation planned next. It mounts on any `<canvas>` and exposes the same
API to React, Vue, Svelte, or plain DOM.

## Live demos

Run `bun run dev`, then open one of the multi-page demo routes:

- `/` — the 2D readable-grid node graph
- `/lane/` — the 1D semantic-zoom lane
- `/cube/` — a 4x4x4 parallel- or cross-eye stereo number puzzle with a live
  RG merge lab and switchable matched/shared/split binocular wire labels
- `/world/` — a walkable stereoscopic voxel-room prototype with focus-depth
  navigation, object manipulation, view-only octree refinement, quick material
  slots, and exactly conserved dyadic mining and placement

The 3D experiment, its whole-interface stereo rendering, viewport-depth wheel
focus, and implemented volumetric RG merge rules are documented in
[docs/cube.md](docs/cube.md).

## Language and i18n

English is the canonical language for source code, UI copy, and project
documentation. The demos do not ship parallel translation catalogs. Optional
runtime translation is a progressive enhancement built on the browser-provided
[`Translator` API](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/ai/translator-api): feature
detect it, check the requested BCP 47 language pair with `availability()`, and
create a translator only after an explicit user action. Unsupported browsers,
mobile implementations without the API, unavailable language packs, and
translation failures retain the original English copy. No cloud translation
service or application-level translation polyfill is required.

## Scope — a graph-GUI library, no I/O

rgui is scoped to **graph GUI + plain data, never transport**. The library renders and
edits graphs (canvas layers, interaction, layout, LOD, overlays) and defines pure-data
vocabularies for hosts to fill (the signal algebra, the `org.rgui.graph.v1` federation
envelope). It performs **no I/O of its own**: no fetch, no WebSocket, no WebRTC, no
polling — conversion functions take an envelope object and return a `Graph`, and how that
envelope traveled is entirely the host app's business (otoji uses WebRTC + a signaling
Worker, agent-yes serves HTTP). Even live embeds are host-owned: rgui offers the generic
node `overlay` slot; the consumer decides whether to glue an iframe into it. Anything
network-shaped (feed clients, subscriptions, share transports) belongs in host apps or a
separate package — not here.

## Install

```bash
bun add @snomiao/rgui
# or
npm install @snomiao/rgui
```

`d3-zoom` / `d3-selection` are pulled in automatically as dependencies. The package is pure
ESM; use it from a bundler (Vite, webpack, esbuild, …) or Node.js ESM.

## Quick start

```ts
import rgui, { demoGraph, type Graph } from "@snomiao/rgui";

const canvas = document.querySelector<HTMLCanvasElement>("#viewer")!;

// Build a dataflow graph in world coordinates, or use demoGraph() to start.
const graph: Graph = {
  nodes: [
    {
      id: "src",
      title: "Camera",
      category: "source",
      x: -256, y: -64, w: 256, h: 128, // on the radix-8 lattice (64 wu at k=1)
      inputs: [],
      outputs: [{ id: "image", label: "image", kind: "image" }],
      fields: [["device", "Default camera"]],
      fieldRules: { device: "set" }, // how this field MERGES when renormalized
    },
    {
      id: "sink",
      title: "Vision model",
      category: "model",
      x: 64, y: -64, w: 256, h: 128,
      inputs: [{ id: "image", label: "image", kind: "image" }],
      outputs: [{ id: "labels", label: "labels", kind: "text" }],
      fields: [["model", "YOLOS-tiny"]],
    },
  ],
  edges: [
    { from: { node: "src", port: "image" }, to: { node: "sink", port: "image" } },
  ],
};

// Mount a readable-grid viewer on the canvas.
const viewer = rgui(canvas, {
  graph,                        // or demoGraph() for a ready-made pipeline
  rule: { collapsePx: 48 },     // tune the readability thresholds (see below)
});

// Pan/zoom (d3-zoom), grid-snapped node dragging, and semantic-zoom LOD
// are all wired up automatically. Clean up when done:
viewer.destroy();
```

The `Rgui` object returned by `rgui(canvas, options)` carries the current view transform
`view`, the resolved rule set `rule`, read/write access to `graph`, a redraw request
`invalidate()`, and `destroy()`. `demoGraph()` returns a ready-made pipeline for smoke
testing — pass it first to see the behavior.

## Keyboard navigation

Enabled by default (`keyboard: false` to opt out). The pan/zoom feel is the
[CapsLockX](https://github.com/snomiao/CapsLockX) time-based acceleration model — a tap
nudges, a hold ramps up — ported from its Rust source of truth (`core/accModel.ts`).
Keys act only while the pointer is over the canvas, and never while typing in a field.

| Keys | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `W` `A` `S` `D` | Pan (hold to accelerate) |
| `R` / `F` | Zoom in / out (about viewport center) |
| `N` / `P` — or `Tab` / `⇧Tab` | Focus next / previous node (selects + pans it to center) |
| `Space` + drag | Pan |
| `?` | Toggle the shortcuts panel |

Tune the acceleration with `keyboardSpeed: { pan?, zoom? }` (units per first-second of
hold; defaults 1600 / 1600, matching CapsLockX).

## RgRule — customizing the readability thresholds

Every readability decision in rgui is concentrated in a single `RgRule` object. Tune these
numbers per use case (dense DAW-style patching, sparse mind maps, dashboards, …). Pass a
partial object as `options.rule`; unspecified fields fall back to the defaults.

| Property | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `minGridPx` | `48` | Minimum on-screen spacing of major grid points (px). The basis of the readable grid. |
| `radix` | `8` | Grid layers are radixⁿ; one higher-order cell spans radix sub-steps per axis. 4/5/8/10/16… |
| `collapsePx` | `56` | A node collapses into a pseudo-node when its screen height falls below this (px). |
| `collapseSnappedPx` | `84` | Members of a flush-snapped stack collapse earlier (snap beats location) — and the whole stack RGs together. |
| `fieldMinPx` | `9` | Hide a node's field text when the row height falls below this (px). |
| `portLabelMinPx` | `6` | Hide port labels when the row height falls below this (px). |
| `clusterGapPx` | `24` | Screen-space gap budget for position-based cluster merging (px). |
| `clusterGapConnectedPx` | `40` | Connected nodes merge across a larger gap (px). |
| `pseudo` | `{ w: 200, headerH: 26, rowH: 18, pad: 8 }` | Pseudo-node screen dimensions in px (constant size on screen). |
| `declutterMarginPx` | `10` | Minimum gap kept between pseudo-nodes after decluttering (px). |
| `alignSnapPx` | `40` | Snap-align magnet: flush-snapping nodes align at the readable start point (tops / reading edge). |
| `direction` | `"ltr"` | Reading direction — decides the vertical-snap alignment edge. |
| `portShape` | `"chevron"` | Ports read the data flow (inputs point in, outputs out); `"dot"` restores circles. |

`DEFAULT_RULE` and `resolveRule(partial)` are exported so you can inspect the defaults or
resolve partial rules independently.

## The rules of the canvas

Everything above zoom is governed by a small set of composable laws:

- **One cell, one thing (一格一物)** — rendered overlap is never allowed: a dragged (or
  projected) node that would cover another pushes out to flush contact instead.
- **Boundary dissolution (辺界消融)** — flush-contact edges fuse: the shared border, the
  internal ports, and the wire between touching nodes dissolve; the connection condenses
  into a flow chevron on the seam. Snapped nodes stay independent — drag one away to split.
- **Snap-connect (吸附成线)** — contact IS the connection. Each node declares the direction
  data runs through it (`flow`: `"ltr"` default, `"rtl"`, `"ttb"`, `"btt"`), which decides
  the edge its inputs sit on and the edge its outputs sit on. Push two nodes flush so that an
  output edge faces a compatible input edge — matching `SignalKind`, port rows aligned within
  half a pitch — and a wire appears, marked `temp: true`. Drag them apart and it is gone: no
  state is kept, the wires are a pure function of geometry (`snapConnections()`), so *cutting*
  a connection costs one drag rather than a click on a 2-px curve. Direction always comes from
  the ports, never from the geometry: an `rtl` pipeline snapped left-to-right still flows
  right-to-left. Authored edges win — a temp wire never steals an input the host already fed.
  Opt out with `snapConnect: false`; mirror the derived set via `onSnapConnectChange`.
- **Snap beats location; stacks RG together** — a fused stack collapses earlier than loose
  neighbors, and as one unit: when any member crosses the threshold, the whole stack becomes
  one block, sized as its members' enclosure (and itself an integer-grid citizen).
- **Chain contraction** — interior nodes of a linear chain (in/out degree 1) contract into a
  compact `⋯ ×N` link while the endpoints stay, regardless of distance.
- **Cascading RG** — if a merged block ends up overlapping anything, they merge too; the
  build runs to a fixed point. Overlap cannot survive a frame.
- **Data merges with structure** — field values aggregate under per-field rules (`max`,
  `min`, `sum`, `mean`, `median`, `range`, `mode` 众数, `set` 集合, `same`, `any`/`all`,
  `first`/`last`/`count`, or custom), declared on the node via `fieldRules`, on the host via
  `fieldSummarize()`, or defaulting to mode. Booleans are ordered — OR ≡ max, AND ≡ min.
  Advanced combinators: `ordered()` (severity/latest), `topK()` (histogram), `quantile()`.
- **Containment scopes the emergence** — `GraphNode.parent` declares that a node lives
  INSIDE another (a structural relation like an edge, never a style tag). The container
  renders as an open frame around its children — the sanctioned exception to one-cell-one-
  thing: a child occupies its container's cell at a finer grid layer. Emergent merging works
  only *within* a scope (a team's members merge into the team, never into the neighboring
  team), and once every child falls below readability the container **absorbs** them into
  one block named by the container. Levels absorb one at a time — teams collapse into team
  blocks long before the company collapses into one company block — so an org chart's
  leader/members/team/company hierarchy IS its RG-level ladder. Dragging a frame carries
  its contents; `orgChartGraph()` demos the whole ladder.
- **Any domain renders** — `SignalKind` and `NodeCategory` are open string types: built-ins
  keep their hand-picked palette, any other name (`"report"`, `"team"`, …) gets a stable
  derived color via `kindColor()`/`categoryColor()` — or assign into `KIND_COLOR`/
  `CATEGORY_COLOR` to pick exact colors. Media pipelines, org charts, dependency graphs —
  no registration required.
- **Selection is RG-level aware** — blocks containing selected members render selected;
  zooming out and back restores the exact original multi-selection; modifying selection at
  a higher level acts on the whole block. Double-click selects a snapped stack.
- **3-D billboard position space** — `viewer.setRotation3({yaw, pitch, roll})` rotates node
  *positions* in 3-D (plus `GraphNode.z` depth) while every node renders as an upright 2-D
  card; the view stays strictly 2-D and all the laws above keep holding. The background
  field arrows lean with the rotation (180° shows the field pointing away: gold crosses).
- **A wire says what it carries** — a port declares whether its signal *adds*
  (`measure`), whether it may be *duplicated or aliased* (`ownership`), and what a
  fan-out *does* with it (`fanout`). rgui refuses `sum` on a state and `broadcast` on a
  singly-owned resource, and draws the three fan-outs as three different wires — full,
  thinned-and-badged `1/n`, dotted. See [docs/signal.md](docs/signal.md) and `signalGraph()`.

## The signal algebra

Three questions, three owners:

| question | field | owned by |
|---|---|---|
| is `+` meaningful across parallel sources? | `measure: "extensive" \| "intensive"` | the port |
| **may** this value be duplicated / aliased? | `ownership: "copy" \| "clone" \| "share" \| "move"` | the **producing port** |
| is it duplicated **here**, or divided? | `fanout: "broadcast" \| "split" \| "route"` | the **fan-out group** |
| what **share** does this wire take? | `Edge.weight` | the **edge** |

`ownership` is Rust's four: a coordinate is free to `copy`, a 4K frame `clone`s *at a
cost*, a `MediaStream` can be `share`d (two nodes borrow the same one, nothing is
duplicated), and a token budget or a lease is a `move` — single owner. The one rule:
**a `move` value may never `broadcast`.** Broadcasting a shared handle is a borrow,
not a copy, so it stays legal; splitting a copyable value is load balancing, not a
safety violation.

Every verdict is **placement-independent** — rgui never needs to know which machine a
node lands on. `isDuplicable()` is the predicate a host composes with its own
placement to decide what can cross a device boundary.

|  | `copy` / `clone` / `share` | `move` |
|---|---|---|
| **extensive** (`sum`/`concat` legal) | STT transcript segments, audio chunks, shard counters | token budget, money, work items |
| **intensive** (`sum` forbidden) | coordinates, image frames, vision labels, a MediaStream | an exclusive lease, a GPU slot |

The tempting model is one axis — *change vs state* — but a cumulative counter is
additive across shards yet must be **copied** on fan-out, and a coin transfer is
additive yet must **never** be copied. Additivity and conservation are orthogonal
(physics agrees: entropy is extensive and not conserved). So `sum` is refused exactly
where it is undefined — adding two positions — while `mean` stays legal, because a
centroid is an affine combination.

`signalConnectionGuard()` plugs into `isValidConnection` and refuses the second wire
off a broadcasting `move` port — and nothing else. Strictness lands where duplication
is *unsafe*, not merely *expensive*.

Full rationale, the `SIGNALS` presets, the diagnostics, and the mapping onto
[sflow](https://github.com/snomiao/sflow)'s `tees` / `distributeBys` / `merges` /
`toLatests`: **[docs/signal.md](docs/signal.md)**.

## API overview

The default export is `createRgui` (alias `rgui`). Named exports additionally expose the rg
math, model, and rendering pieces for standalone use without building the full UI. Everything
is framework-agnostic pure functions and plain data.

- **High level**: `createRgui` — interaction callbacks (`onNodeMove(End)`, `onConnect` +
  `isValidConnection`, `onSnapConnectChange`, `onNodeClick`/`onNodeContextMenu`,
  `onEdgeClick`/`onEdgeContextMenu`,
  `onConnectEnd`, `onSelectionChange`, `onPinChange`, `onNodeResize(End)`,
  `onCanvasContextMenu`), viewer methods (`setGraph`, `snapGraph`, `autoLayout`, `fitView`,
  `setView`, `setRotation3`, `setSelection`, `setPanels`, `setNodeOverlay`, `resizeNode`,
  `setTheme`, e2e accessors `portScreenPos`/`edgeMidScreen`), options (`rule`, `summarize`,

  helpers (`childrenOf`, `descendantsOf`, `containerIds`,
  `containmentOf`), types `Graph`, `GraphNode` (incl. `z`, `pinned`, `parent`, `flow`,
  `fieldRules`, `body`, `draw`, `overlay`), `Edge` (incl. `temp`), `Flow`, `Side`
- **Semantic-zoom LOD** (`core/lod`): `buildRenderGraph`, `pseudoRect`, `pseudoPortPos`
- **Packing** (`core/pack`): `resolveOverlap`, `flushSegments`, `flushComponents`,
  `computePortLayout`, `clampSize`, `snapConnections`
- **Data merge** (`core/aggregate`): `aggregate`, `fieldSummarize`, `defaultSummarize`,
  `ordered`, `topK`, `quantile`, type `MergeRule`
- **Signal algebra** (`core/signal`): `SIGNALS` presets, `checkSignals`,

  `isDuplicable`, `isAliasable`, `portMerge`, `splitQuantity`, `splitAtoms`, `routeIndex`,
  types `Measure`, `Ownership`, `Fanout`, `Grain`, `SignalSpec`, `Atomizer` — what a wire
  carries and what happens when it forks or converges. See [docs/signal.md](docs/signal.md)
- **Graph CRDT** (`core/crdt`): `newGraphCrdt`, `crdtAddNode`/`crdtSetFields`/
  `crdtRemoveNode`/`crdtAddEdge`/`crdtRemoveEdge`, `mergeGraphCrdt`, `crdtToGraph`,
  types `GraphCrdtState`, `JoinRule`, `Dot`, `Clock` — a dependency-free,
  transport-agnostic CRDT for syncing graphs between replicas: observed-remove
  presence (concurrent add wins, no tombstones), deterministic Lamport-LWW field
  registers with opt-in semilattice joins (`max`/`min`/`any`/`all`), plain-JSON
  states, deterministic merge. rgui ships the data type; hosts move the bytes.
- **Federation** (`core/federation`): `FEDERATED_GRAPH_SCHEMA`,
  `FEDERATED_DEMO_CHAIN_IDS`, `clampFederatedGraph`, `federatedGraphToRgui`,
  `federatedDemoChain`, `federatedDemoChainGraph`, `federatedNodeId`,
  types `FederatedGraphEnvelope`, `FederatedNode`, `FederatedEdge` — a read-only
  semantic graph envelope for showing
  agent-yes, otoji, and other systems in one canvas without moving transport/execution
  policy into rgui. See [docs/federation.md](docs/federation.md)
- **Layout** (`core/layout`): `layoutGraph`
- **Renderers** (`render`): Canvas 2D layers, `createWebGPUGridRenderer` (grid underlay),
  panels (`panelLayout`/`drawPanels`), HTML overlays (`createOverlayManager`),
  `KIND_COLOR`/`CATEGORY_COLOR` + `kindColor`/`categoryColor`

TypeScript type definitions are bundled. To read the source directly, the raw TypeScript is
available from the `@snomiao/rgui/src` subpath.

## Roadmap

- **WebGPU** — the grid/field underlay already renders on WebGPU (`renderer: "auto"`, with a
  quiet canvas2d fallback); wires and node blocks move behind the same seam next.
- Scaling the LOD pipeline to much larger graphs (spatial indexing).
- i18n for docs (English-first for now).

## Mascot — Royal Gramma

<img src="assets/rgui-icon-128.png" width="128" height="128" align="right" alt="rgui icon — Royal Gramma crossover field, one eye at the head">

The face of the project is the Royal Gramma (*Gramma loreto*), a small Caribbean reef fish whose
body shifts from violet to gold across a single seamless crossover — and whose initials happen to
spell **R**oyal **G**ramma = **RG**, the same letters as the renormalization group (a pun, not the
name's origin — see the top of this README). Look closely at a real one and the transition zone is
literally gold speckles over purple: the fish dithers itself, organically. One continuous flow,
readable at every scale.

The icon is implemented as a **function of position**, not a bitmap: it is generated natively at
any resolution from 8² to 4K, never resampled, always exactly 4 colors. The gradient direction is
the projection of the fish's 3-D swim direction — when the head points at the viewer, eyes appear.
The animated version advances exactly one scale octave per loop — a literal renormalization-group
flow — so frame N is pixel-for-pixel identical to frame 0. PNG sizes and loop GIFs (steady +
wandering) live in `assets/`, together with the generator (`assets/icon-lab.html`).
